ðŸ§© What `.terraform.lock.hcl` is

This file is automatically generated by Terraform when you run `terraform init`.
It locks provider versions and checksums so that everyone (and every CI/CD run) uses the exact same provider versions.

It's absolutely OK (and recommended) to commit `.terraform.lock.hcl` to GitHub. It's part of Terraform's dependency management system (similar to `package-lock.json` for npm or `poetry.lock` for Python).
